# TOP-RockPaperScissors

I created a dialog box rock-paper-scissors game! <br/>
The instruction asked for console.log but for presentation purposes, I replaced it with alert(). <br/>
I wanted to make it accessible to folks who don't know about browser console. <br/>

Logic

1. Create function for bot to randomly return 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'

2. Computer should prompt user to select 'Rock, 'Paper', or 'Scissors' for each round

3. Submission should be case-insensitive; Convert cases

4. After user submits their 'hand', computer should return user's hand and bot's hand, and declare the round winner

5. Keep up with players' score

6. End the game after five rounds 

7. Declare game winner
